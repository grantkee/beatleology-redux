# About this project

The primary focus of this project was back-end development. I wanted to work with JSON Web Tokens and troubleshoot authentication and authorization. Ultimately, I found a solution for HTTP applications, but there are still vulnerabilities within this project. This project continues to be a challenging learning experience as I pursue solutions for stronger security within web-based applications.

If you decide to signup and test the login, please use unique passwords and emails. Again, this project is a way for me to learn and experiement with application security. While certainly not my intention, it's best to assume that the information you provide is exposed to third-parties. For this reason, I am not verifying email addresses. All passwords are stored in the database as hashed versions using JWT.

The idea behind using Beatleology is to help others identify their inner Beatle with a simple quiz. I do not own any of the material in the quiz. I simply organized it as a side project to practice my own coding skills. Please enjoy! If you find this app amusing, please support the authors by purchasing a copy of their book. They provide much more insight and information that's waiting for you to discover.
